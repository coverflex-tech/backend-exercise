# Benefits

Challenge was done in ~4-5h

To run the project clone it and run `mix ecto.setup`. After all the dependencies have been installed successfully, run `mix phx.server`.

- Code coverage at 89.8% (only tested at controller level)
- No credo & sobelow warnings (only skipped Config.HTTPS check because it's a challenge and porbably will never go to production ðŸ˜…)
- Added sample data on `seeds.exs` file (2 users and 4 products)
